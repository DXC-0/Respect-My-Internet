# RESPECT-MY-INTERNET

> Privacy is important to you, as I understand you, the internet has become a trash can, filled with big companies wanting to retrieve your data. Surfing the internet is like getting naked on the street. Here I suggest you dress lol! Say goodbye to all gafam, trackers, advertisements, disrespectful services and I will gradually add the CTI feeds, malware, so that you are protected automatically.
